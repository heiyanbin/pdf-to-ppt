Introduction
Large language models are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks:
Advances in reasoning; multimodality, and tool use have unlocked a new category of LLM-powered
systems known as agents
This guide is designed for product and engineering teams exploring how to build their first agents,
distilling insights from numerous customer deployments into practical and actionable best
practices. It includes frameworks for identifying promising use cases, clear patternsfordesigning
agent logic and orchestration, and best practices to ensure your agents run safely; predictably;
and effectively:
After reading this guide, you'Il have the foundational knowledge you need to confidently start
building your first agent
                                                                          Apractical guide to building agents

  What is an
agent?
 While conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able
 to perform the same workflows on the users' behalfwith a high degree of independence:
    Agents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf:
 Aworkflow is a sequence of steps that must be executed to meet the user's goal, whether thats
 resolving a customer service issue, booking a restaurant reservation, committing a code change,
 or generating a report:
 Applications that integrate LLMs but don't use them to control workflow execution--think simple
 chatbots, single-turn LLMs, or sentiment classifiers--are not agents:
 More concretely, an agent possesses core characteristics that allow it to act reliably and
 consistently on behalf of a user:
 01       It leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions It recognizes
          when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case
          of failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the User:
 02       It has access to various tools to interact with external systems-both to gather context
          and to take actions and dynamically selects the appropriate tools depending on the
          workflow's current state, always operating within clearly defined guardrails:
                                                                           'practical guide to building agents

When shouldyou
build an agent?
Building agents requires rethinking how your systems make decisions and handle complexity:
Unlike conventional automation, agents are uniquely suited to workflows where traditional
deterministic and rule-based approaches fall short:
Consider the example of payment fraud analysis. A traditional rules engine works like a checklist;
flagging transactions based on preset criteria. In contrast, an LLM agent functions more like a
seasoned investigator, evaluating context, considering subtle patterns, and identifying suspicious
activity even when clear-cut rules aren't violated: This nuanced reasoning capability is exactly what
enables agents to manage complex, ambiguous situations effectively:

 Asyou evaluate where agents can add value, prioritize workflows that have previously resisted
automation, especially where traditional methods encounter friction:
 01      Complex                 Workflows involving nuanced judgment, exceptions, or
         decision-making:        context-sensitive decisions; for example refund approval
                                 in customer service workflows;
 02       Difficult-to-maintain  Systems that have become unwieldy due to extensive and
          rules:                 intricate rulesets, making updates costly or error-prone;
                                 for example performing vendor security reviews:
03        Heavy reliance on      Scenarios that involve interpreting natural language;
          unstructured data:     extracting meaning from documents, or interacting with
                                  users conversationally, for example processing a home
                                 insurance claim:
Before committing to building an agent, validate that your use case can meet these criteria clearly:
Otherwise; a deterministic solution may suffice
                                                                         'practical guide to building agents

 Agent design
foundations
In its most fundamental form, an agent consists of three core components:
01       Model                The LLM powering the agents reasoning and decision-making
 02      Tools                External functions or APIs the agent can use to take action
03      Instructions          Explicit guidelines and guardrails defining how the
                              agent behaves
Here's what this looks like in code when using OpenAI's Agents SDK You can also implement the
same conceptsusingyour preferred library or building directly from scratch:
    Python
        weather_agent   Agent (
    2       name="Weather agent" _
    3       instructions="You are  helpful agent who can talk to users about the
        weather .
    5       tools-[get_weather] ,
                                                                  'practical guide to building agents

Selecting your models
  Different models have different strengths and tradeoffs related to task complexity; latency; and
cost. As we"Il see in the next section on Orchestration, you might want to consider using a variety
of models for different tasks in the workflow:
  Not every task requires the smartest model--a simple retrieval or intent classification task may be
handled by a smaller; faster model, while harder tasks like deciding whether to approve a refund
  may benefit from a more capable model,
 An approach that works well is to build your agent prototype with the most capable model for
every task to establish a performance baseline. From there, try swapping in smaller models to see
ifthey still achieve acceptable results This way, you don't prematurely limit the agent's abilities,
 and you can diagnose where smaller models succeed or fail:
 In summary; the principles for choosing a model are simple:
 01      Set up evals to establish a performance baseline
  02      Focus on meeting your accuracy target with the best models available
  03     Optimize for cost and latency by replacing larger models with smaller ones
          where possible

Defining tools
 Tools extend your agent"s capabilities by using APIs from underlying applications or systems For
legacy systems without APIs, agents can rely on computer-use models to interact directly with
 those applications and systems through web and application Uls--just as a human would:
 Each tool should have a standardized definition, enabling flexible, many-to-many relationships
between tools and agents. Well-documented, thoroughly tested, and reusable tools improve
discoverability, simplify version management; and prevent redundant definitions
 Broadly speaking, agents need three types of tools:
 Type              Description                            Examples
 Data             Enable agents to retrieve context and   Query transaction databases or
                  information necessary for executing     systems like CRMs, read PDF
                   the workflow:                          documents, or search the web:
 Action            Enable agents to interact with         Send emails and texts, update a CRM
                  systems to take actions such as         record, hand-off a customer service
                   adding new information to              ticket to a human:
                  databases, updating records, or
                  sending messages:
Orchestration     Agents themselves can serve as tools    Refund agent, Research agent,
                  for other agents ~see the Manager       Writing agent:
                  Pattern in the Orchestration section:
                                                                         'practical guide to building agents

For example, here's how you would equip the agent defined above with a series of tools when using
the Agents SDK:
    Python
        from agents import Agent_ WebSearchTool, function_tool
        @function_tool
     3  def save_results(output) :
     4       db.insert({"output" output, "timestamp" datetime.time( ) })
     5       return "File saved"
     6
        search_agent   Agent(
            name="Search agent
     8      instructions="Help the user search the internet and save results if
    10  asked
    11      tools-[WebSearchTool ( ) , save_results] ,
    12
As the number of required tools increases, consider splitting tasks across multiple agents
(see Orchostration):
10                                                                'practical guide to building agents

Configuring instructions
High-quality instructions are essential for any LLM-powered app, but especially critical for agents
Clear instructions reduce ambiguity and improve agent decision-making; resulting in smoother
 workflow execution and fewer errors:
 Best practices for agent instructions
 Use existing documents           When creating routines, use existing operating procedures,
                                  support scripts, or policy documents to create LLM-friendly
                                  routines In customer service for example, routines can roughly
                                   map to individual articles in your knowledge base:
  Prompt agents to break          Providing smaller; clearer steps from dense resources
  down tasks                      helps minimize ambiguity and helps the model better
                                  follow instructions:
 Define clear actions              Make sure every step in your routine corresponds to a specific
                                  action or output: For example; a step might instruct the agent
                                  toask the user for their order number or to call an API to
                                  retrieve account details:Being explicit about the action (and
                                  even the wording ofauser-facing message) leaves less room
                                  for errors in interpretation:
Capture edge cases                Real-world interactions often create decision points such as
                                  how to proceed when a user provides incomplete information
                                  or asks an unexpected question. A robust routine anticipates
                                  common variations and includes instructions on how to handle
                                  them with conditional steps or branches such as an alternative
                                  step ifa required piece of info is missing:
                                                                           'practical guide to building agents

    You can use advanced models, like 01 or 03-mini, to automatically generate instructions from
    existing documents. Here's a sample prompt illustrating this approach:
Unset

Orchestration
 With the foundational components in place;    can consider orchestration patterns to enable
                                          you
your agent to execute workflows effectively:
While it's tempting to immediately build a fully autonomous agent with complex architecture;
customers typically achieve greater success with an incremental approach:
In general, orchestration patterns fall into two categories:
01       Single-agent systems;, where a single model equipped with appropriate tools and
         instructions executes workflows in a loop
02       Multi-agent systems; where workflow execution is distributed across multiple
         coordinated agents
Let's explore each pattern in detail.
                                                                          'practical guide to building agents

Single-agent systems
A single agent can handle many tasks by incrementally adding tools, keeping complexity
manageable and simplifying evaluation and maintenance: Each new tool expands its capabilities
without prematurely forcing you to orchestrate multiple agents:
               Input                  Agent                 Output
                                  Instructions
                                      Tools
                                   Guardrails
                                      Hooks
Every orchestration approach needs the concept of a 'run; typically implemented as a loop that
lets agents operate until an exit condition is reached  Common exit conditions include tool calls,
  certain structured output; errors; or reaching a maximum number of turns:
                                                                  'practical guide to building agents

For example, in the Agents SDK, agents are started using the Runner _ run( ) method, which loops
over the LLM until either:
01        final-output tool is invoked, defined by a specific output type
 02                                                 (eg,=           message)
         The model returns a response without any tool calls  a direct user
Example usage:
    Python
        Agents run(agent , [UserMessage ( "What  the capital of the USA?" ) 1)
This concept ofa while loop is central to the functioning ofan agent. In multi-agent systems, as
you'Il see next; you can have sequence of tool calls and handoffs between agents but allow the
model to run multiple steps until an exit condition is met_
An effective strategy for managing complexity without switching to a multi-agent framework is to
use prompt templates Rather than maintaining numerous individual prompts for distinct use
cases, use a single flexible base prompt that accepts policy variables. This template approach
adapts easily to various contexts, significantly simplifying maintenance and evaluation. As new use
casesarise, you can update variables rather than rewriting entire workflows
    Unset

        {{user_first_name}} who has been member for {{user_tenure}}   The user

        user , thank them for being loyal customer , and answer any questions the
        user may have
                                                                 'practical guide to building agents

When to consider creating multiple agents
Our general recommendation is to maximize a single agent's capabilities first More agents can
provide intuitive separation of concepts, but can introduce additional complexity and overhead,
so often a single agent with tools is sufficient
For many complex workflows, splitting up prompts and tools across multiple agents allows for
improved performance and scalability When your agents fail to follow complicated instructions
Orconsistently select incorrect tools, you may need to further divide your system and introduce
more distinct agents:
Practical guidelines for splitting agents include:
Complex logic                      When prompts contain many conditional statements
                                  (multiple if-then-else branches) and prompt templates get
                                  difficult to scale, considerdividing   logical segment across
                                                                    each
                                  separate agents:
Tool overload                      The issue isn't solely the number of tools, but their similarity
                                  or overlap. Some implementations successfully manage
                                   more than 15 well-defined, distinct tools while others struggle
                                   with fewer than 10 overlapping tools. Use multiple agents

Multi-agent systems
While multi-agent systems can be designed in numerous ways for specific workflows and
requirements, our experience with customers highlights two broadly applicable categories:
Manager (agents as tools)         A central "manager" agent coordinates multiple specialized
                                 agents via tool calls, eachhandling specific task or domain:
              (agents handing     Multiple agents operate as peers, handing off tasks to one
Decentralized
off  agents)                      another based on their specializations:
   to
Multi-agent systems can be modeled as graphs, with agents represented as nodes. In the manager
pattern; edges represent tool calls whereas in the decentralized pattern, edges represent handoffs
that transfer execution between agents:
Regardless of the orchestration pattern, the same principles apply: keep components flexible,
composable, and driven by clear; well-structured prompts:
                                                                          'practical guide to building agents

 Manager pattern
 The manager pattern empowers a central LLM-the "manager"_to orchestrate a network of
specialized agents seamlessly through tool calls. Instead of losing context or control, the manager
intelligently delegates tasks to the right agent at the right time; effortlessly synthesizing the results
into a cohesive interaction: This ensures a smooth, unified user experience, with specialized
 capabilities always available on-demand_
 This pattern is ideal for workflows where you only want one agent to control workflow execution
 and have access to the user_
  Translate  hello  to                                 Task         Spanish agent

For example; here's howyou could implement this pattern in the Agents SDK:
    Python
        from agents import Agent , Runner
     3  manager_agent Agent (
           name="manager_agent"
     5     instructions=(

   25
   26  async def main() :
   27      msg   input ( "Translate hello' to Spanish, French and Italian for me! " }
   28
   29      orchestrator_output   await Runner.run(
   30          manager_agent,msg)
   32
   32      for message in orchestrator_output.new_messages:
   33          print(f"    Translation step: {message.content}")
  Declarative vs non-declarative graphs
  Some frameworks are declarative; requiring developers to explicitly define every branch, loop,
  and conditional in the workflow upfront through graphs consisting of nodes (agents) and
  edges (deterministic or dynamic handoffs) While beneficial for visual clarity, this approach
  can quickly become cumbersome and challenging as workflows grow more dynamic and
  complex, often necessitating the learning of specialized domain-specific languages
  In contrast; the Agents SDK adopts a more flexible; code-first approach Developers can
  directly express workflow logic using familiar programming constructs without needing to
  pre-define the entire graph upfront,enabling more dynamic and adaptable agent orchestration.

Decentralized pattern
In a decentralized pattern; agents can 'handoff workflow execution to one another: Handoffs are a
one way transfer that allow an agent to delegate to another agent In the Agents SDK, handoff is

This pattern involves using many agents on equal footing, where one agent can directly hand
off control of the workflow to another agent: This is optimal when you don't need a single agent
maintaining central control or synthesis-instead allowing each agent to take over execution and
interact with the user as needed:
                                                                    Issues and Repairs

the input concerns a recent purchase, the triage_agent would invoke a handoffto the
order_management_agent, transferring control to it:
This pattern is especially effective for scenarios like conversation triage; or whenever you prefer
           specialized agents to fully take over certain tasks without the original agent needing to remain
           involved: Optionally, you can equip the second agent with a handoff back to the original agent,
allowing it to transfer control again if necessary:

Guardrails
Well-designed guardrails help you manage data privacy risks (for example, preventing system
prompt leaks) or reputational risks (for example, enforcing brand aligned model behavior}
You can set up guardrails that address risks you've already identified for  use case and layer

LLM-based deployment; but should be coupled with robust authentication and authorization
protocols, strict access controls, and standard software security measures:

Think of guardrails as a layered defense mechanism. While a single one is unlikely to provide
                                  sufficient protection, using multiple, specialized guardrails together creates more resilient agents.

Types of guardrails
Relevance classifier                Ensures agent responses stay within the intended scope
                                    by flagging off-topic queries:
                                    For example; "How tall is the Empire State Building?" is an
                                   off-topic user input and would be flagged as irrelevant_
Safety classifier                   Detects unsafe inputs (jailbreaks or prompt injections)
                                   that attempt to exploit system vulnerabilities

                                     as unsafe
PII filter                           Prevents unnecessary exposure of personally identifiable
                                   information (PII) by vetting model output for any potential PII:
Moderation                         Flags harmful or inappropriate inputs (hate speech,
                                    harassment; violence) to maintain safe, respectful interactions:
Tool safeguards                    Assess the risk of each tool available to your agent by assigning
                                   a rating-Iow, medium, or high-based on factors like read-only
                                   vs. write access, reversibility, required account permissions, and
                                    financial impact: Use these risk ratings to trigger automated
                                   actions, such as pausing for guardrail checks before executing
                                   high-risk functions or escalating to a human if needed

Rules-based protections          Simple deterministic measures (blocklists, input length limits,
                                  regex filters) to prevent known threats like prohibited terms or
                                  SQL injections:

The Agents SDK treats guardrails as first-class concepts, relying on optimistic execution by
default: Under this approach, the primary agent proactively generates outputs while guardrails
                 triggering exceptions if constraints are breached
run concurrently;
Guardrails can be implemented as functions or agents that enforce policies such as jailbreak
prevention; relevance validation, keyword filtering; blocklist enforcement; or safety classification:
For example; the agent above processes a math question input optimistically until the
math_ homework_tripwire guardrail identifies a violation and raises an exception:
    Plan for human intervention
    Human intervention is a critical safeguard enabling you to improve an agent's real-world
   performance without compromising user experience It's especially important early
    in deployment, helping identify failures; uncover edge cases, and establish a robust
    evaluation cycle:
    Implementing a human intervention mechanism allows the agent to gracefully transfer
    control when it can't complete a task In customer service; this means escalating the issue
    to a human agent: For a coding agent, this means handing control back to the user:
    Two primary triggers typically warrant human intervention:
        Exceeding failure thresholds: Set limits on agent retries or actions. If the agent exceeds
                   (e.g- fails to understand customer intent after multiple attempts) escalate
        these limits
        to human intervention:
        High-risk actions: Actions that are sensitive, irreversible; or have high stakes should
        trigger human oversight until confidence in the agent's reliability grows. Examples
        include canceling user orders, authorizing large refunds, or making payments
                                                                            'practical guide to building agents

 Conclusion
 Agents mark a new era in workflow automation; where systems can reason through ambiguity take
 action across tools, and handle multi-step tasks with a high degree of autonomy. Unlike simpler
 LLM applications, agents execute workflows end-to-end, making them well-suited for use cases
 that involve complex decisions, unstructured data, or brittle rule-based systems.
 To build reliable agents, start with strong foundations: pair capable models with well-defined tools
 and clear; structured instructions. Use orchestration patterns that match your complexity level,
starting with a single agent and evolving to multi-agent systems only when needed. Guardrails are
critical at every stage, from input filtering and tool use to human-in-the-loop intervention, helping
 ensure agents operate safely and predictably in production:
 The path to successful deployment isn't all-or-nothing: Start small, validate with real users, and
 grow capabilities over time. With the right foundations and an iterative approach, agents can
 deliver real business value-automating not just tasks, but entire workflows with intelligence
 and adaptability:
